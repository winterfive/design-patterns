# design-patterns

I am creating these files to study the various design patterns and to use them as a resource in the future.

<b>Design Principle:</b> In code, some aspects will stay the same while others will change.  Identify the ones that will change and encapsulate them to allow the code to be easily updated in the future.

<b>Design Principle:</b> Develop loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

<b>Design Principle:</b> Program to an interface, not an implementation.

<b>Design Principle:</b> Favor composition over inheritance.  

<b>Design Principle:</b> OPEN/CLOSED PRINCEPLE - Classes should be open to extension and closed to modification.

<b>Design Principle:</b> DEPENDANCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE - Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
