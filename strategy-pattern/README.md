Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern encapsulates a group of algorithms to make them interchangable.  Encapsulation also allows for modifications to be made to either group of algorithms without requiring changes to the rest of the code.  My example uses two groups: TauntBehavoirs and AttackBehaviors.
