## Decorator Pattern  

The decorator pattern can add more options to an object dynamically (during runtime).  
This allows for expansion of code without requiring several new classes to be created (subclassing).

## Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.  

## Tips  

Decorators are the same type of the components they decorate.  

You can wrap a concrete coponent with many decorators.
