## Iterator Pattern

This pattern uses an iterator interface to give us access to different types of collections (Arrays, 
ArrayLists, HashMaps, Lists, etc).  We don't need to know what kind of collection it is to access it.
We use one interface to access and use data from different collections.  This keeps our code loosely coupled.
